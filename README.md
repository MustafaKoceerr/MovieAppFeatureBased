## ‚ú® Features

### User-Facing Features
- Multi-language support with instant language switching (app & API language)
- Light, dark, and system theme selection with a single tap
- Explore movies by category: Popular, Now Playing, Top Rated, Upcoming
- Powerful search for movies, series, and actors with pagination
- Offline-first experience: fast loading, caching, and pagination (Paging 3)
- Seamless login with token-based authentication (web approval flow)
- Persistent login: token stored securely, auto-login if valid
- Easy logout with a single tap
- Settings screen for theme, language, and account management
- Share movie details with friends
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Smooth transitions and animations for enhanced user experience**
- **Shimmer loading animation on every screen for network data**

### Architectural Highlights
- Clean Architecture with strict separation of concerns
- Modularized project structure (feature & core modules)
- Type-safe, encapsulated navigation via navigation-contracts
- Centralized, unified database (Room)
- AppException: unified error handling, surfaced to UI via core-ui
- Offline-first data strategy for home/list screens (cache, fast load)
- Pagination in search & list screens
- Language & API key as interceptors for network requests
- Enum-based language architecture: add a new language with a single line
- UI contracts: consistent, maintainable screen logic
- Best practices applied, pitfalls avoided
- Shimmer loading animation for all network-fetched data (user always sees a polished loading state)
- Smooth transitions between screens and UI states

### Module Responsibilities
- **app**: Application entry, DI setup, navigation host, global config
- **core-domain**: Business logic, domain models, contracts
- **core-ui**: Shared UI components, themes, error UI, UI contracts
- **core-network**: Network layer, API config, interceptors
- **core-database**: Room DB, DAOs, caching
- **core-preferences**: DataStore, user preferences (theme, language, token)
- **core-android**: Android-specific utilities, base ViewModel
- **feature-movies**: Home, list, details, search screens & logic
- **feature-auth**: Authentication (login, logout, token flow)
- **feature-splash**: Splash screen, initial loading
- **navigation-contracts**: Type-safe navigation contracts, decoupled navigation

## üß© Architectural Summary
- **Clean Architecture**: Strict separation (domain, data, presentation)
- **MVI Pattern**: Unidirectional data flow, UI contracts for all screens
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt for scalable, testable DI
- **Modularization**: Each feature/core is a separate Gradle module
- **Offline-First**: Caching, fast load, pagination
- **Type-Safe Navigation**: navigation-contracts for decoupled, safe navigation
- **Unified Error Handling**: AppException, surfaced to UI
- **Best Practices**: Naming, file structure, code quality

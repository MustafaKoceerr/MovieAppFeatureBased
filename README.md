## 🎯 **Core Technologies & Architecture**

### **🏗️ Architectural Patterns**
- **Clean Architecture** - Domain-driven design with clear layer separation
- **MVI (Model-View-Intent)** - Unidirectional data flow and predictable state management
- **Feature-Based Modularization** - Independent, scalable module structure
- **Repository Pattern** - Centralized data management and caching strategies
- **Use Case Pattern** - Business logic encapsulation and testability

### **⚡ Modern Technology Stack**
- **Jetpack Compose** - 100% declarative UI with Material 3 design
- **Kotlin Coroutines & Flow** - Reactive programming and async operations
- **Hilt Dependency Injection** - Compile-time DI with lifecycle awareness
- **Room Database** - Local data persistence with type-safe queries
- **Retrofit + OkHttp** - Network layer with intelligent interceptors
- **Paging 3** - Efficient data loading with RemoteMediator pattern

### **🎨 UI/UX Excellence**
- **Material 3 Design System** - Consistent, modern interface design
- **Dynamic Theming** - System-aware color schemes and dark mode
- **Type-Safe Navigation** - Compile-time route validation
- **Responsive Layouts** - Adaptive UI for all screen sizes
- **Accessibility First** - WCAG compliant interface design
